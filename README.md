# Little Lemon Food Ordering App

Welcome to the Little Lemon Food Ordering App repository! This project is the culmination of my efforts throughout the course Meta iOS Developer on Coursera, showcasing my skills in fetching data from the network, storing it in a database, and presenting it in a SwiftUI mobile application.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this assessment is to consolidate my knowledge and understanding of key course objectives. By creating a food-ordering app for the Little Lemon restaurant, I demonstrate my ability to:

- Fetch data from a network source.
- Store data in a database.
- Extract and manipulate data for use in a SwiftUI mobile application.

## Features

### 1. Dynamic Menu Display
The app presents a dynamic menu of items available for ordering at Little Lemon restaurant. Leverage SwiftUI to create an engaging and user-friendly interface.

### 2. Customization Options
Users can customize their browsing experience by enabling filters to show only specific categories of items. Additionally, a powerful search feature allows users to locate items by name efficiently.

### 3. Network Fetching
Make efficient network calls to retrieve the list of menu items from the specified URL. The app starts with a layout foundation, and your task is to complete it by populating it with the fetched data.

### 4. Database Integration
Implement database functionality to store the fetched data, ensuring seamless access to information even when the app is offline.

### 5. SwiftUI Magic
Leverage SwiftUI's capabilities to convert the fetched data into a visually appealing and responsive format within the app.

### 6. SQL Transactions
Implement SQL transactions to enable sorting and filtering of the menu items, enhancing the overall user experience.
